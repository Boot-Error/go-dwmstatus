go-dwmstatus
============

Fork off ctgrl/go-dwmstatus that doesn't require any external libraries.
Displays current mpd song, the three loadaverages, date and time, and the current battery level.

If you aren't running MPD, it will not work. Just remove the function and modify the status set to suit your preferences.
The same goes for battery. If you for whatever reason want to run this on a desktop or battery-less machine, 
you should just remove everything related to battery.
